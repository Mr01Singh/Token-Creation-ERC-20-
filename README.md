# Token Creation (ERC-20)

## Project Description
This project implements a basic ERC-20 token smart contract in Solidity. The contract includes fundamental functions like token transfer, approval, and transfer on behalf of another address (allowance). It allows users to create their own cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, clear, and reusable template for creating ERC-20 tokens that can be deployed for various applications such as digital assets, utility tokens, or in-app currencies. This forms the foundation for learning token standards and developing blockchain-based projects.

## Key Features
- Token transfer between addresses
- Approval mechanism to delegate token spending
- Transfer tokens on behalf of another user via allowance
- Fully compliant with basic ERC-20 interface
- Easy to customize token name, symbol, and supply

## Future Scope
- Implement advanced ERC-20 features like minting and burning
- Add pausing functionality to freeze token transfers in emergencies
- Integrate with decentralized exchanges (DEX)
- Add governance capabilities for token holders
- Include detailed security audits and gas optimization
